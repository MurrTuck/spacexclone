<!-- I was looking into codecademy to start learn coding. But then I got an email from codecademy saying that if I buy pro,
someone else would get PRO for free to help during COVID-19...

Just wondering, because I am one of those people that were affected by COVID-19 and was laid off from my job. That's why
I'm looking to learn coding. How do I get to be on that other end, when someone buys PRO, I could get it for free? -->
